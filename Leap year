PROGRAM:

import java .util.Scanner;
public class leapyear {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Enter year:");
        Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
        int year = sc.nextInt();
        if (year%4==0 || year%400==0){
            System.out.println(+ year + "is a Leap year");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(+ year + "is not a Leap year");
        }
        sc.close();
        }
    }

OUTPUT:
Enter year:
2008
2008 is a Leap year
Enter year:
2015
2015 is a Leap year
